## _4. Client-Server Model Learning Exercise_ ðŸ§ <br>

**_1. What is a Server?_**<br>

<p>A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client. On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system that receives requests for a web files and sends those files to the client.</p><br>

**_2. Why is a Client?_**<br>

<p>A client is the receiving end of a service or the requestor of a service in a client/server model type of system. The client is most often located on another system or computer, which can be accessed via a network. This term was first used for devices that could not run their own programs, and were connected to remote computers that could via a network. These were called dumb terminals and they were served by time-sharing mainframe computers.</p><br>

**_3. Is a server just another physical computer?_** <br>

<p>a server can be a physical machine, a virtual machine or even a software performing server services. So the way a server functions depends on how the word server is used in a context.</p><br>

- Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?<br>
<p>Because they allow us to create local web servers, which is that server installed on a specific computer in order to work offline and online. It is a      particularly useful alternative if we are looking for an environment in which to develop a website or an application and that allows us to perform all kinds of tests without running risks.</p><br>

- What is the difference?<br>

a physical server is a computer configured and capable of providing an internet service, such as allowing access to web pages stored on its hard disk, allowing mail exchange, etc. A virtual server is a logical instance or portion of a physical server, configured to act as a server, that is, within a physical server with the appropriate configuration and software, virtual servers can be created to provide services by distributing the resources of the physical server among several virtual servers as needed.

A somewhat informal comparison would be a familiar package of cookies (physical server) where inside there are several individual cookie packages (virtual server).<br>
