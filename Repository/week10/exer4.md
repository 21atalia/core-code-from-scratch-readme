<p>A client is the receiving end of a service or the requestor of a service in a client/server model type of system. The client is most often located on another system or computer, which can be accessed via a network. This term was first used for devices that could not run their own programs, and were connected to remote computers that could via a network. These were called dumb terminals and they were served by time-sharing mainframe computers.</p><br>
