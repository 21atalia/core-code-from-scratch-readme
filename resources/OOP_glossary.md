<h2>OOP Glossary</h2>

## **_1. Abstraction_**

An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.

## **_2. Inheritance_**

is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes on the basis of already existing classes. It provides flexibility to the child class to reuse the methods and variables of a parent class.

## **_3. Polymorphism_**

objects share an interface (the way in which their features are accessed) but each object can implement them differently.

## **_4. Encapsulation_**

each object is responsible for specific tasks. The implementation of the object's features is enclosed in its properties and methods, and hidden from the rest of the application.

## **_5. Class_**

defines the properties and behavior of a type of object (its characteristics). For example car.

## **_6. Object_**

is the instance (concrete element) of a class. For example the car with license plate 7777XXX

## **_7. Instance_**

any object that derives from some other object is called instance. In this way, all objects are instances of some other, except the Object class, which is the mother of them all.

## **_8. Interface_**

are used to indicate which methods a Class must necessarily implement (contain) (although they do not have to behave in the same way).

## **_9. Access Modifiers_**

are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or type. This section introduces the four access modifiers:

- public
- protected
- internal
- private

## **_10. Constructors_**

is a set of instructions specially designed to initialize an instance of an object. When you create a new instance of the class, the constructor creates a new object with the class shape and initializes it with the values passed to it.
